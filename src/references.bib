	abstract = {It is now known (or in some cases just believed) that many quantum field theories exhibit dualities, equivalences with the same or a different theory in which things appear very different, but the overall physical implications are the same. We will discuss some of these dualities from the point of view of a mathematician, focusing on "charge conservation" and the role played by K-theory and noncommutative geometry. Some of the work described here is joint with Mathai Varghese and Stefan Mendez-Diez; the last section is new. },

	abstract = {Although it has been a well-known fact, for more than two decades, that category theory is needed for the study of topological orders, it is still a non-trivial challenge for students and working physicists to master the abstract language of category theory. In this work, for those who have no background in category theory, we explain in great details how the structure of a (braided) fusion category naturally emerges from lattice models and physical intuitions. Moreover, we show that nearly all mathematical notions and constructions in fusion categories and its representation theory, such as (monoidal) functors, Drinfeld center, module categories, Morita equivalence, condensation completion and fusion 2-categories, naturally emerge from lattice models and physical intuitions. In this process, we also introduce some basic notions and important results of topological orders. },

@book{grensing2013structural-aspe,
	abstract = {This book is devoted to the subject of quantum field theory. It is divided into two volumes. The first can serve as a textbook on the main techniques and results of quantum field theory, while the second treats more recent developments, in particular the subject of quantum groups and noncommutative geometry, and their interrelation.

The first volume is directed at graduate students who want to learn the basic facts about quantum field theory. It begins with a gentle introduction to classical field theory, including the standard model of particle physics, general relativity, and also supergravity. The transition to quantized fields is performed with path integral techniques, by means of which the one-loop renormalization of a self-interacting scalar quantum field, of quantum electrodynamics, and the asymptotic freedom of quantum chromodynamics is treated. In the last part of the first volume, the application of path integral methods to systems of quantum statistical mechanics is covered. The book ends with a rather detailed investigation of the fractional quantum Hall effect, and gives a stringent derivation of Laughlin's trial ground state wave function as an exact ground state.

The second volume covers more advanced themes. In particular Connes' noncommutative geometry is dealt with in some considerable detail; the presentation attempts to acquaint the physics community with the substantial achievements that have been reached by means of this approach towards the understanding of the elusive Higgs particle. The book also covers the subject of quantum groups and its application to the fractional quantum Hall effect, as it is for this paradigmatic physical system that noncommutative geometry and quantum groups can be brought together.},

	abstract = {In accordance with recent progress of fracton topological phases, unusual topological phases of matter hosting fractionalized quasiparticle excitations with mobility constraints, new type of symmetry is studied -- multipole symmetry, associated with conservation of multipoles. Based on algebraic relation between dipole and global charges, we introduce a series of $(d+1)$-dimensional BF theories with $p$-form gauge fields, which admit dipole of spatially extended excitations, and study their physical properties. We elucidate that gauge invariant loops have unusual form, containing linear function of the spatial coordinate, which leads to the position dependent braiding statistics and unusual ground state degeneracy dependence on the system size. We also show that the theories exhibit a mixed 't Hooft anomaly between $p$-form and $(d-p)$-form dipole symmetries, which is canceled by an invertible theory defined in one dimensional higher via anomaly inflow mechanism. },

Three major applications of general relativity are then discussed: black holes, perturbation theory and gravitational waves, and cosmology. Students will learn the origin of how spacetime curves (the Einstein equation) and how matter moves through it (the geodesic equation). They will learn what black holes really are, how gravitational waves are generated and detected, and the modern view of the expansion of the universe. A brief introduction to quantum field theory in curved spacetime is also included. A student familiar with this book will be ready to tackle research-level problems in gravitational physics.},

	abstract = {These notes are intended to be a pedagogical introduction to higher-form symmetries, which are symmetries whose charged objects are extended operators supported on lines, surfaces, and etc. This subject has been one of the most popular and effervescent topics of theoretical physics in recent years. Gauge theories are central in the study of higher-form symmetries, with Wilson and 't Hooft operators corresponding to the charged objects. Along these notes, we discuss in detail some basic aspects, including Abelian Maxwell and Chern-Simons theories, and $SU(N)$ non-Abelian gauge theories. We also discuss spontaneous breaking of higher-form symmetries. },

	abstract = {The theory cf quadratic forms and the intimately related theory of sym metrie bilinear forms have a lang and rich his tory, highlighted by the work of Legendre, Gauss, Minkowski, and Hasse. (Compare [Dickson] and [Bourbaki, 24, p. 185].) Our exposition will concentrate on the rela tively recent developments which begin with and are inspired by Witt's 1937 paper ``Theorie der quadratischen Formen in beliebigen K{\"o}rpern.'' We will be particularly interested in the work of A. Pfister and M. Knebusch. However, some older material will be described, particularly in Chapter II. The presentation is based on lectures by Milnor at the Institute for Ad vanced Study, and at Haverford College under the Phillips Lecture Pro gram, during the Fall of 1970, as weIl as Iectures at Princeton University il1 1966. We want to thank J. Cunningham, M. Knebusch, M. Kneser, A. Rosenberg, W. Scharlau and J.-P. Serre for helpful suggestions and corrections. Prerequisites. The reader should be familiar with the rudiments of algebra., incJuding for example the concept of tensor product for mo dules over a commutative ring. A few individual sections will require quite a bit more. The logical relationship between the various chapters can be roughly described by the diagram below. There are also five appendices, largely self-contained, which treat special topics. I. Arbitrary commutative rings I H. The ring of V. Miscellaneous IIl. Fields integers examples IV.

While the classical Chern-Simons theories are classified by an integral lattice the quantum theories are classified differently. Two quantum theories are equivalent if they have the same invariants on 3-manifolds with spin structure, or equivalently if they lead to equivalent projective representations of the modular group. We prove the quantum theory is completely determined by three invariants which can be constructed from the data in the classical action. We comment on implications for the classification of fractional quantum Hall fluids.},

In a similar w a y , possible Wess-Zumino interactions of such a group G are classified by H3(G, Z). The relation between three dimensional Chern-Simons gauge theory and two dimensional sigma models involves a certain natural map from
H4(BG,Z) to H3(G,Z). We generalize this correspondence to topological ``spin'' theories, which are defined on three manifolds with spin structure, and are related to what might be called Z2 graded chiral algebras (or chiral superalgebras) in two dimensions. Finally we discuss in some detail the formulation of these topological gauge theories for the special case of a finite group, establishing links with two dimensional (holomorphic) orbifold models.},

In addition to the usual local Gauss law constraints, the physical Hilbert space is defined by 1-form gauge constraints implementing the compactness of the $U(1)$ gauge group, and (depending on the details of the spatial lattice) non-local constraints which project out unframed Wilson loops. Though the ingredients of the lattice model are bosonic, the physical Hilbert space is finite-dimensional, with exactly $k$ ground states on a spatial torus. We quantize both the bosonic (even level) and fermionic (odd level) theories, describing in detail how the latter depends on a choice of spin structure.},

	abstract = {We discuss the question of when a gapped 2D electron system without any symmetry has a protected gapless edge mode. While it is well known that systems with a nonzero thermal Hall conductance, KH≠0, support such modes, here we show that robust modes can also occur when KH=0 -- if the system has quasiparticles with fractional statistics. We show that some types of fractional statistics are compatible with a gapped edge, while others are fundamentally incompatible. More generally, we give a criterion for when an electron system with abelian statistics and KH=0 can support a gapped edge: we show that a gapped edge is possible if and only if there exists a subset of quasiparticle types M such that (1) all the quasiparticles in M have trivial mutual statistics, and (2) every quasiparticle that is not in M has nontrivial mutual statistics with at least one quasiparticle in M. We derive this criterion using three different approaches: a microscopic analysis of the edge, a general argument based on braiding statistics, and finally a conformal field theory approach that uses constraints from modular invariance.

	abstract = {The study of the mapping class group Mod(S) is a classical topic that is experiencing a renaissance. It lies at the juncture of geometry, topology, and group theory. This book explains as many important theorems, examples, and techniques as possible, quickly and directly, while at the same time giving full details and keeping the text nearly self-contained. The book is suitable for graduate students.


A Primer on Mapping Class Groups begins by explaining the main group-theoretical properties of Mod(S), from finite generation by Dehn twists and low-dimensional homology to the Dehn-Nielsen-Baer theorem. Along the way, central objects and tools are introduced, such as the Birman exact sequence, the complex of curves, the braid group, the symplectic representation, and the Torelli group. The book then introduces Teichm{\"u}ller space and its geometry, and uses the action of Mod(S) on it to prove the Nielsen-Thurston classification of surface homeomorphisms. Topics include the topology of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, the connection with surface bundles, pseudo-Anosov theory, and Thurston's approach to the classification.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for extracting topological data from translation invariant generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two-dimensional systems, focusing on the analysis of anyon excitations and string operators. The algorithm applies to Zd qudits, including instances where d is a nonprime number. This capability allows the identification of topological orders that may differ from Zd toric codes, thereby extending the scope beyond the established theorem that Pauli stabilizer codes of ℤp qudits (with p being a prime) are equivalent to finite copies of Zp toric codes and trivial stabilizers. The algorithm is designed to determine all anyons and their string operators, enabling the computation of their fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics. The method converts the identification of topological orders into computational tasks, including Gaussian elimination, the Hermite normal form, and the Smith normal form of truncated Laurent polynomials. Furthermore, the algorithm provides a systematic approach for studying quantum error-correcting codes. We apply it to various codes, such as self-dual CSS quantum codes modified from the color code and non-CSS quantum codes that contain the double semion topological order or the six-semion topological order.},

@article{wang2020in-and-around-a,
	abstract = {Anyon models are algebraic structures that model universal topological properties in topological phases of matter and can be regarded as mathematical characterization of topological order in two spacial dimensions. It is conjectured that every anyon model, or mathematically unitary modular tensor category, can be realized as the representation category of some chiral conformal field theory, or mathematically vertex operator algebra/local conformal net. This conjecture is known to be true for abelian anyon models providing support for the conjecture. We reexamine abelian anyon models from several different angles. First anyon models are algebraic data for both topological quantum field theories and chiral conformal field theories. While it is known that each abelian anyon model can be realized by a quantum abelian Chern-Simons theory and chiral conformal field theory, the construction is not algorithmic. Our goal is to provide such an explicit algorithm for a K-matrix in Chern-Simons theory and a positive definite even one for a lattice conformal field theory. Secondly anyon models and chiral conformal field theories underlie the bulk-edge correspondence for topological phases of matter. But there are interesting subtleties in this correspondence when stability of the edge theory and topological symmetry are taken into consideration. Therefore, our focus is on the algorithmic reconstruction of extremal chiral conformal field theories with small central charges. Finally we conjecture that a much stronger reconstruction holds for abelian anyon models: every abelian anyon model can be realized as the representation category of some non-lattice extremal vertex operator algebra generalizing the moonshine realization of the trivial anyon model.},

We show that the order in such fluids can be characterized by a symmetric matrix K, in terms of which various physical quantities can be determined. We construct K by a matrix iteration procedure which may be decomposed into two simple elementary steps. The hierarchy construction is shown to be contained in our matrix iteration construction. The relationship between the vortex basis and the dual electron basis is clarified. We also show that under certain mild assumptions the generalized hierarchy construction exhausts all possible Abelian fractional quantum Hall states. We identify and determine the topological quantity known as the shift. Our formalism may be relevant for recent experimental data on multilayered systems.},

@article{conrad2022gottesman-kitae,
	abstract = {We examine general Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes for continuous-variable quantum error correction, including concatenated GKP codes, through the lens of lattice theory, in order to better understand the structure of this class of stabilizer codes. We derive formal bounds on code parameters, show how different decoding strategies are precisely related, propose new ways to obtain GKP codes by means of glued lattices and the tensor product of lattices and point to natural resource savings that have remained hidden in recent approaches. We present general results that we illustrate through examples taken from different classes of codes, including scaled self-dual GKP codes and the concatenated surface-GKP code.

Error correction is extremely important in quantum computers because quantum systems are very shy: as soon as someone observes them, they stop displaying their most peculiar features. If the state was supposed to encode some information to transmit or process, uncontrolled interactions of the system with its surroundings may result in logical errors. To overcome this, some form of error correction must be used: instead of being directly printed onto a quantum system, information is embedded into some larger space in such a way as to be screened from the typical interactions that occur with the environment. The embedding is called error correcting code. Bosonic codes embed finite systems (such as qubits) into infinite-dimensional ones. Here we are interested in so-called Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes, named after their inventors. They rely on discrete translation symmetries in the phase space of an ensemble of harmonic oscillators. Such symmetries are represented by lattices, which are mathematical objects studied in many branches of pure and applied mathematics and information science. This article elaborates on general methods to analyse and construct GKP codes grounded on results from lattice theory.},

@article{ellison2022pauli-stabilize,
	abstract = {We construct a Pauli stabilizer model for every two-dimensional Abelian topological order that admits a gapped boundary. Our primary example is a Pauli stabilizer model on four-dimensional qudits that belongs to the double semion (DS) phase of matter. The DS stabilizer Hamiltonian is constructed by condensing an emergent boson in a 
Z
4
 toric code, where the condensation is implemented at the level of the ground states by two-body measurements. We rigorously verify the topological order of the DS stabilizer model by identifying an explicit finite-depth quantum circuit (with ancillary qubits) that maps its ground-state subspace to that of a DS string-net model. We show that the construction of the DS stabilizer Hamiltonian generalizes to all twisted quantum doubles (TQDs) with Abelian anyons. This yields a Pauli stabilizer code on composite-dimensional qudits for each such TQD, implying that the classification of topological Pauli stabilizer codes extends well beyond stacks of toric codes---in fact, exhausting all Abelian anyon theories that admit a gapped boundary. We also demonstrate that symmetry-protected topological phases of matter characterized by type-I and type-II cocycles can be modeled by Pauli stabilizer Hamiltonians by gauging certain

@book{wen2007quantum-field-t,
	abstract = {For most of the last century, condensed matter physics has been dominated by band theory and Landau's symmetry breaking theory. In the last twenty years, however, there has been an emergence of a new paradigm associated with fractionalization, emergent gauge bosons and fermions, topological order, string-net condensation, and long range entanglements. These new physical concepts are so fundamental that they may even influence our understanding of the origin of light and electrons in the universe. This book is a pedagogical and systematic introduction to the new concepts and quantum field theoretical methods in condensed matter physics. It discusses many basic notions in theoretical physics which underlie physical phenomena in nature, including a notion that unifies light and electrons. Topics covered include dissipative quantum systems, boson condensation, symmetry breaking and gapless excitations, phase transitions, Fermi liquids, spin density wave states, Fermi and fractional statistics, quantum Hall effects, topological/quantum order, and spin liquid and string-net condensation. Methods discussed include the path integral, Green's functions, mean-field theory, effective theory, renormalization group, bosonization in one- and higher dimensions, non-linear sigma-model, quantum gauge theory, dualities, projective construction, and exactly soluble models beyond one-dimension.},

	abstract = {We study topological boundary conditions in abelian Chern--Simons theory and line operators confined to such boundaries. From the mathematical point of view, their relationships are described by a certain 2-category associated to an even integer-valued symmetric bilinear form (the matrix of Chern--Simons couplings). We argue that boundary conditions correspond to Lagrangian subgroups in the finite abelian group classifying bulk line operators (the discriminant group). We describe properties of boundary line operators; in particular we compute the boundary associator. We also study codimension one defects (surface operators) in abelian Chern--Simons theories. As an application, we obtain a classification of such theories up to isomorphism, in general agreement with the work of Belov and Moore.},

@book{nakahara2003geometry-topolo,
	abstract = {Differential geometry and topology have become essential tools for many theoretical physicists. In particular, they are indispensable in theoretical studies of condensed matter physics, gravity, and particle physics. Geometry, Topology and Physics, Second Edition introduces the ideas and techniques of differential geometry and topology at a level suitable for postgraduate students and researchers in these fields.

The second edition of this popular and established text incorporates a number of changes designed to meet the needs of the reader and reflect the development of the subject. The book features a considerably expanded first chapter, reviewing aspects of path integral quantization and gauge theories. Chapter 2 introduces the mathematical concepts of maps, vector spaces, and topology. The following chapters focus on more elaborate concepts in geometry and topology and discuss the application of these concepts to liquid crystals, superfluid helium, general relativity, and bosonic string theory. Later chapters unify geometry and topology, exploring fiber bundles, characteristic classes, and index theorems. New to this second edition is the proof of the index theorem in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The final two chapters are devoted to the most fascinating applications of geometry and topology in contemporary physics, namely the study of anomalies in gauge field theories and the analysis of Polakov's bosonic string theory from the geometrical point of view.

Geometry, Topology and Physics, Second Edition is an ideal introduction to differential geometry and topology for postgraduate students and researchers in theoretical and mathematical physics.},

@book{baez1994gauge-fields-kn,
	abstract = {This is an introduction to the basic tools of mathematics needed to understand the relation between knot theory and quantum gravity. The book begins with a rapid course on manifolds and differential forms, emphasizing how these provide a proper language for formulating Maxwell's equations on arbitrary spacetimes. The authors then introduce vector bundles, connections and curvature in order to generalize Maxwell theory to the Yang-Mills equations. The relation of gauge theory to the newly discovered knot invariants such as the Jones polynomial is sketched. Riemannian geometry is then introduced in order to describe Einstein's equations of general relativity and show how an attempt to quantize gravity leads to interesting applications of knot theory.

@book{francesco1997conformal-field,
	abstract = {Filling an important gap in the literature, this comprehensive text develops conformal field theory from first principles. The treatment is self-contained, pedagogical, and exhaustive, and includes a great deal of background material on quantum field theory, statistical mechanics, Lie algebras and affine Lie algebras. The many exercises, with a wide spectrum of difficulty and subjects, complement and in many cases extend the text. The text is thus not only an excellent tool for classroom teaching but also for individual study. Intended primarily for graduate students and researchers in theoretical high-energy physics, mathematical physics, condensed matter theory, statistical physics, the book will also be of interest in other areas of theoretical physics and mathematics. It will prepare the reader for original research in this very active field of theoretical and mathematical physics.},

It introduces the basics of perturbative string theory, world-sheet supersymmetry, space-time supersymmetry, conformal field theory and the heterotic string, before describing modern developments, including D-branes, string dualities and M-theory. It then covers string geometry and flux compactifications, applications to cosmology and particle physics, black holes in string theory and M-theory, and the microscopic origin of black-hole entropy. It concludes with Matrix theory, the AdS/CFT duality and its generalizations. This book is ideal for graduate students and researchers in modern string theory, and will make an excellent textbook for a one-year course on string theory. It contains over 120 exercises with solutions, and over 200 homework problems with solutions available on a password protected website for lecturers at www.cambridge.org/9780521860697.},

Volume 1, first published in 1998, provides a thorough introduction to the bosonic string. The first four chapters introduce the central ideas of string theory, the tools of conformal field theory and of the Polyakov path integral, and the covariant quantization of the string. The next three chapters treat string interactions: the general formalism, and detailed treatments of the tree level and one loop amplitudes. Chapter eight covers toroidal compactification and many important aspects of string physics, such as T-duality and D-branes. Chapter nine treats higher-order amplitudes, including an analysis of their finiteness and unitarity, and various nonperturbative ideas. An appendix giving a short course on path integral methods is included. This is an essential text and reference for graduate students and researchers interested in modern superstring theory.},

The book first introduces the type I, type II, and heterotic superstring theories and their interactions. It then goes on to present important recent discoveries about strongly coupled strings, beginning with a detailed treatment of D-branes and their dynamics, and covering string duality, M-theory, and black hole entropy, and discusses many classic results in conformal field theory. The final four chapters are concerned with four-dimensional string theories, and have two goals: to show how some of the simplest string models connect with previous ideas for unifying the Standard Model; and to collect many important and beautiful general results on world-sheet and spacetime symmetries.},

@article{dymarsky2021quantum-stabili,
	abstract = {There is a rich connection between classical error-correcting codes, Euclidean lattices, and chiral conformal field theories. Here we show that quantum error-correcting codes, those of the stabilizer type, are related to Lorentzian lattices and non-chiral CFTs. More specifically, real self-dual stabilizer codes can be associated with even self-dual Lorentzian lattices, and thus define Narain CFTs. We dub the resulting theories code CFTs and study their properties. T-duality transformations of a code CFT, at the level of the underlying code, reduce to code equivalences. By means of such equivalences, any stabilizer code can be reduced to a graph code. We can therefore represent code CFTs by graphs. We study code CFTs with small central charge c = n ≤12, and find many interesting examples. Among them is a non-chiral E8 theory, which is based on the root lattice of E8 understood as an even self-dual Lorentzian lattice. By analyzing all graphs with n ≤8 nodes we find many pairs and triples of physically distinct isospectral theories. We also construct numerous modular invariant functions satisfying all the basic properties expected of the CFT partition function, yet which are not partition functions of any known CFTs. We consider the ensemble average over all code theories, calculate the corresponding partition function, and discuss its possible holographic interpretation. The paper is written in a self-contained manner, and includes an extensive pedagogical introduction and many explicit examples.},

The authors also continue to examine related problems such as the kissing number problem, the covering problem, the quantizing problem, and the classification of lattices and quadratic forms. Like the first edition, the second edition describes the applications of these questions to other areas of mathematics and science such as number theory, coding theory, group theory, analog-to-digital conversion and data compression, n-dimensional crystallography, and dual theory and superstring theory in physics. Results as of 1992 have been added to the text, and the extensive bibliography - itself a contribution to the field - is supplemented with approximately 450 new entries.},

@misc{barbar2023global-symmetri,
	abstract = {We consider abelian topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) in 3d and show that possible gaugings of invertible global symmetries naturally give rise to additive codes. These codes emerge as non-anomalous subgroups of the 1-form symmetry group, parameterizing fusion rules of condensable TQFT anyons, and the boundary theories dual to TQFTs with the anyons condensed (i.e. with the corresponding symmetry subgroup gauged) are ``code CFTs''. This observation bridges together, in the holographic sense, results on 1-form symmetries in 3d TQFTs with developments connecting codes to 2d CFTs. Building on this relationship, we proceed to consider an ensemble of maximal gaugings (gaugings of Lagrangian subgroups) for a given 3d TQFT and propose that it has a holographic interpretation as an ensemble of boundary code CFTs dual to a gravitational theory -- the bulk TQFT summed over geometries.},

Our construction results in rational CFTs, which cover a larger set of points in the moduli space of Narain CFTs than the previous one.

	abstract = {We provide a precise relation between an ensemble of Narain conformal field theories (CFTs) with central charge c=n, and a sum of (U(1)×U(1))n Chern-Simons theories on different handlebody topologies. We begin by reviewing the general relation of additive codes to Narain CFTs. Then we describe a holographic duality between any given Narain theory and a pure Chern-Simons theory on a handlebody manifold. We proceed to consider an ensemble of Narain theories, defined in terms of an ensemble of codes of length n over ℤk×ℤk for prime k. We show that averaging over this ensemble is holographically dual to a level-k (U(1)×U(1))n Chern-Simons theory, summed over a finite number of inequivalent classes of handlebody topologies. In the limit of large k the ensemble approaches the ensemble of all Narain theories, and its bulk dual becomes equivalent to ``U(1)-gravity'' - the sum of the pertubative part of the Chern-Simons wavefunction over all possible handlebodies - providing a bulk microscopic definition for this theory. Finally, we reformulate the sum over handlebodies in terms of Hecke operators, paving the way for generalizations},
